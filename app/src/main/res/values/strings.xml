    <string name="about">\tThis is one of the first versions of the application.
        This is a reason why it may contain some typos and not optimal tasks for each level.
        We will be happy to hear from you any suggestions, propositions, and concerns how to improve
        it. Please, email us at \nvikles.games.dev@gmail.com.\n\tDepending on the success of the application,
        the number of questions will be increased, and their quality will be improved regularly.
        Also, translations into different languages will be added gradually.\n\tThis is a free but
        ad-based application. We hope that some advertisements will not overshadow the enjoyment
        of the game. Otherwise, you can always purchase an ad-free version.\n\tPlease, keep in mind, some
        questions in the “Impossible” level are quite complicated and you may need a piece of paper
        and a pencil to solve them. If you can solve tasks from this category mentally, you are a
        true genius!\n\tEnjoy your time here in BRAIN &amp; MIND: LOGIC PUZZLES AND GAMES. We wish
        you success and good luck in your intellectual adventure.
